# Mathematicians often strive for abstraction, trying to prove theorems with as few hypotheses
# as possible. This is often for pragmatic reasons: a theorem with fewer (or weaker) hypotheses will apply
# to more situations and require less work to use. Other times, it is for aesthetic reasons:
# mathematicians are curious to know how generally a certain result holds, and if there is a
# clean way to characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions.

# This desire for abstraction led mathematicians, over centuries, to identify certain kinds
# of structures that appear again and again. While the /concrete/ instances of these
# structures may be quite different --
# for example, the set of integers, the set of isomorphisms from a set to itself, and the set
# of symmetries of a cube -- they share certain high-level properties of interest. Using
# terminology you've seen already, these structures are all /models/ for one particular theory.

# The study of these fundamental structures and their models is called /algebra/, or sometimes /abstract
# algebra/ to distinguish it from the algebra learned in school.

# (FINISH INTRO)

# ** Groups

# One of the most common and fundamental algebraic structures is the /group/. A group is a set
# $G$ that has a special element $e$, a binary operation $\cdot$ (with codomain $G$), and a unary operation $inv$
# (usually written in postfix notation, $^{-1}$). Rather than describing $inv$ as a unary function,
# we often describe it by saying "for every element $g \in G$, we have an associated element $g^{-1}$."

# Having these attributes alone isn't enough to make a group. The operations and constant need
# to satisfy certain axiomatic properties:

# - $\cdot$ is associative -- for any $f, g, h \in G$, $(f \cdot g) \cdot h = f \cdot (g \cdot h)$
# - $e$ is nilpotent -- for any $g \in G$, $e \cdot g = g \cdot e = g$
# - inverses cancel -- for any $g \in G$, $g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} \cdot g = e$

# Notice that we have just defined a first-order $L$-structure and theory. A bit more formally: a
# group is a model for the theory with constant $e$, function symbols $\cdot$ and $^{-1}$, and axioms

# - $\forall f \forall g \forall h ((f \cdot g) \cdot h = f \cdot (g \cdot h))$
# - $\forall g (e \cdot g = g \wedge g \cdot e = g)$
# - $\forall g (g \cdot g^{-1} = e \wedge g^{-1} \cdot g = e)$

# (A brief but important aside: we often write "let G be a group," but since we have defined a group to be a
# model of a particular structure, this isn't quite right. Technically, a group is a set $G$ bundled
# with the identity element and multiplication and inverse operations. Often, though, these operations
# are implicit, or we just use the notation $e$, $\cdot$ and $\inv$. In these cases, "let G be a group" is shorthand
# for "let $\langle G, e, \cdot, \inv \rangle$ be a group.")

# What are some examples of groups? There are many -- remember that, even though we use the symbol $\cdot$
# for the binary group operation and $^{-1}$ for the inverse operation, our concrete groups do not
# need to use this notation.

# - The integers $\ZZ$ form a group when $\cdot$ is interpreted as addition, $inv$ as negation, and $e$ as $0$.
#   It is easy to check that the group axioms hold: e.g., for any $g \in \ZZ$, $g + (-g) = 0$.
# - Similarly, the rational numbers $\QQ$ also form a group using addition, negation, and $0$.
# - Take our domain to again be $\QQ$. When we interpret $\cdot$ as multiplication, $e$ as $1$, and $inv$ as
#   reciprocation (that is, $(\frac{a}{b})^{-1} = \frac{b}{a}$),  we do /not/ get a group. Why not? The inverse we have
#   defined here is not a total function -- there is no value set yet for $0^{-1}$. Of course, we could always
#   pick an arbitrary value for this (say, $0$), but the value must satisfy our third axiom
#   $0 \cdot 0^{-1} = 1 \wedge 0^{-1} \cdot 0 = 1$. Since there is no value we can multiply by $0$ to get 1,
#   this cannot hold. So we cannot define a group using multiplication over all of $\QQ$.
# - However, the interpretation above works perfectly well if we choose the domain $\QQ \setminus \{0\}$, the
#   set of rationals excluding 0.
# - Let $S_n = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}$, and think of this set as coming "in order." A /permutation/ of $S_n$ is a
#   shuffling of the order of its elements. For example, "flipping the first two elements" is a permutation;
#   applying this permutation to $S_n$ gives the ordered set $\{2, 1, 3, \ldots, n\}$. Permutations can be composed:
#   given two permutations, do the first shuffle, and then do the second shuffle to the resulting set. There is a
#   nilpotent permutation, which doesn't move any elements at all; composing this permutation with a second is the same
#   as just applying the second. And permutations can be "undone," by "reversing" the shuffle. This is a (partial, informal)
#   argument that the set of permutations of $S_n$ forms a group. How could we make the notion of a "shuffle" more precise?
#   How would we show, formally, that this set does form a group?

# On the surface, these concrete groups look very different: the set of permutations of $S_n$ seems
# nothing like the set of integers. But some properties, consequences of the group axioms, hold in every group.

# --------------------------
# *Theorem.* Let $G$ be a group. The identity element $e \in G$ is unique. That is: if for some element $e' \in G$,
# we have $\forall g (e' \cdot g = g \wedge g \cdot e' = g)$, then $e' = e$.

# *Proof.* Applying our hypothesis, we see that $e' \cdot e = e$. Applying the nilpotency axiom, we see that
# $e' \cdot e = e'$. Therefore, by the symmetry and transitivity of equality, e' = e.

# # Multiply both sides by $e^{-1}$ on the right, to get
# # $(e' \cdot e) \cdot e^{-1} = e \cdot e^{-1}$. Using the inverse axiom, the right hand side is equal to $e$:
# # $(e' \cdot e) \cdot e^{-1} = e. Using the associativity axiom, the left hand side is equal to e' \cdot (e \cdot e^{-1}),
# # which is equal to $e' \cdot e$ (by the inverse axiom), which is equal to $e'$ (by nilpotency). So we have derived $e' = e$.
# --------------------------
# --------------------------
# *Theorem.* Let $G$ be a group. For each $g \in G$, $g\inv$ is unique. That is: If for some element $h \in G$,
# we have $g\cdot h = e \wedge h \cdot g = e$, then $h = g\inv$.

# *Proof.* If $g \cdot h = e$, then $g\inv \cdot (g \cdot h) = g\inv \cdot h = g\inv$. By associativity, the right hand side
# is equal to $(g\inv \cdot g) \cdot h = e \cdot h = h$, so we have $h = g\inv$.
# --------------------------

# Suppose that $G$ is a group and $g \in G$. For a positive integer $n$, we write $g^n$ as shorthand for
# $g \cdot g \cdot \ldots \cdot g$, where $g$ is repeated $n$ times. (We can extend this notation to allow $n$ to be any
# integer: $g^0 = e$ and $g^{-n} = (g\inv)^n$ when $n$ is positive.) The /order/ of $g$ is the smallest positive integer
# $n$ such that $g^n = e$, if such an $n$ exists. (Can you think of an example of a group $G$ and an element $g \in G$ with
# infinite order?)

# --------------------------
# *Theorem.* Let $G$ be a finite group. Every $g \in G$ has finite order, and this order is at most the cardinality of $G$.

# *Proof.* We examine the sequence of group elements $g, g^2, g^3, \ldots$. Since $G$ is finite, these elements cannot
# all be different: there are some positive $k$ and $l$, with $k > l$, such that $g^k = g^{k - l}$. We may assume that $k$
# is the smallest value for which we can find an $l$ with this property. (This is just to say that $g^k$ is the first "repeat"
# occurrence of an element of the sequence.) Note also that $k \le |G| + 1$, since we cannot go more than $|G|$ steps
# without a repeat; therefore $l \le |G|$.

# We have that $g^{k - l}\cdot g^l = g^k = g^{k - l}$, and similarly $g^l \cdot g^{k - l} = g^l$. Since we have shown that
# in every group the identity $e$ is unique, this implies that $g^l = e$. We leave it as an exercise to the reader to argue
# that $l$ is the smallest number for which this is true. Therefore, the order of $g$ is $l \le |G|$.
# --------------------------

# ** Fields

# Another very important algebraic structure is the /field/. The notion of a field /extends/ that of a group -- that is, a field
# is a group with some additional properties.

# Let $F$ be a set, $0, 1 \in F$, $add, mul$ be binary operations on $F$, and $neg, inv$ be unary operations on $F$.
# We will use the infix notation $+$ and $\cdot$ for $add$ and $mul$, the prefix notation $-$ for neg, and the postfix
# notation $\inv$ for $inv$. We say that $F$ is a field if the following conditions hold:
# - $\langle F, 0, +, - \rangle$ forms a group
# - $\langle F \setminus \{0\}, 1, \cdot, \inv \rangle$ forms a group
# - The operations $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative: for all $a, b \in F$, $a + b = b + a$ and $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
# - Multiplication distributes over addition: for all $a, b, c \in F$, $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c).

# This description may seem a bit opaque, but once again, there are many familiar examples of fields. We argued earlier that
# the first two bullet points hold for the rationals $\QQ$, under the obvious interpretation;
# it is easy to confirm that the second two bullets hold as well. Similarly, the obvious interpretation on the reals $\RR$
# forms a field.

# There are also less familiar examples of fields. Let $F = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$, and define $+$ and $\cdot$ as binary functions
# on $F$ using modular arithmetic. (That is: if $a + b \ge 5$ when $a$ and $b$ are considered as natural numbers, we define
# $a + b$ on $F$ to be the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 5.) One can show the existence of additive and multiplicative
# inverses on $F$, and distributivity follows from distributivity on $\NN$; therefore this structure forms a field.
# In fact, for any prime $p$, the set $F = \{0, 1, \ldots, p - 1\}$ forms a field.

# There are many situations in mathematics that seem to "require" real numbers: consider a vector space, for example,
# whose objects can be stretched or compressed by any factor $r \in \RR$. Often, there is nothing essential about $\RR$ in
# these situations. The rationals $\QQ$ might work just as well; sometimes, it is just the field operations and axioms
# that are needed. Other times, perhaps a field with additional properties -- an ordering of the elements, or a norm --
# is required. The power of algebraic reasoning allows us to specify, axiomatically, exactly which properties we need. We
# avoid being unnecessarily specific in our definitions and theorems, and the fact that they hold for a particular structure
# (say, $\RR$) is a simple consequence of the fact that the structure forms a field.
